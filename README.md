# Acknowledgements

* Without Wolfie's modding [wiki](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki), [tutorials](https://wittlewolfie.github.io/WW-Blueprint-Core/articles/intro.html), and help in discord, there would not have been any possibility of me making a mod even as small as this. Thank you Wolfie!
* A big thank you to Bubbles for their help troubleshooting in discord and for doing some testing,
* Last but not least, thank you to Holic92 for creating the [Call of the Wild](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderkingmaker/mods/112) mod for kingmaker. The taunting stance rage power in that mod gave me a great jumping off point!
